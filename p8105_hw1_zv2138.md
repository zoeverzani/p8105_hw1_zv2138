Problem 1

``` r
problem_1_df = tibble(
  random_samp = rnorm(10),
  is_positive = random_samp > 0,
  cat_names = c('Susan', 'Helen', 'Sally', 'Matt', 'George', 'Paolo', 'Oliver',
               'Zoe', 'Paul', 'Laura'),
  cats_colors = factor(c("Black", "White", "Red", "Black", "Red", "Red",
                         "Black", "White", "White", "Black"))
)
```

``` r
mean(pull(problem_1_df, random_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.4816624

``` r
mean(pull(problem_1_df, is_positive))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(problem_1_df, cat_names))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem_1_df, cat_names)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem_1_df, cats_colors))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem_1_df, cats_colors)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

What works and what doesn’t?

I was able to take the mean of my random\_samp variable. This makes
sense to me because we are taking the mean value from a set of 10
numbers.

I was able to take the mean of my is\_positive variable. This produced a
numeric output. This doesn’t make sense to me because this variable is
of type logic and stores True and False values. It doesn’t make sense
that R thinks you can take the mean of True and False statements.

I was not able to take the mean of my character vector cat\_names. My
function returned NA. This makes sense to me because this vector holds
characters. You can not take the mean of a set of characters.

I was not able to take the mean of my factor vector. My function
returned NA. This makes sense to me because the input argument is not
numeric.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem_1_df, is_positive))
as.numeric(pull(problem_1_df, cat_names))
as.numeric(pull(problem_1_df, cats_colors))
```

What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens when you try
to take the mean?

My logical vector was converted into a list of numeric 1’s and 0’s. It
seems that R stores logical variables as either a 0 for FALSE or a 1 for
TRUE. This makes sense why we were able to take the mean of my logical
is\_positive variable because R is calculating the mean of 10 numbers
made up of 0’s and 1’s.

My character vector called cat\_names returned a list of 10 NAs. This
makes sense why we were not able to return a mean value. Character
strings can not be formated into numbers so a mean can not be cacluated
so my mean function feturn NA.

My factor vector returned a list of 1’s, 2’s, and 3’s. These numbers
correspond to what level each vector entry is coded for. For example
Black is coded as level 1, Red as level 2 and White as level 3.
